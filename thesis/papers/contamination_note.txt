 I am sorry for the late in reporting this which I promised in the
Tuesday night. 

   In this study I took all formulas from the thesis of Spentzouris of E665.

   For each given gas there is correspondent pressure for a given temperature.
The sum of these gas pressure, taking into account of their fraction in the gas
composition, is the total pressure measured. 

   Starting from guestimated temperature and given pressure from the 
measurement and new H2 and HD pressure are calculated. A new D2 
pressure is then calculated based on the fraction of gas composition and
the weighted pressure sum to be measured pressure. With new D2 pressure
then new temperature is found by solving the relation between D2 pressure
and temperature. This process is repeated until the solution is stabilized.

   For LD2 target, I started from 100% pure D2 and with 794 torr, nominal 
value. I got still 794 torr as expected.

   Changing the fraction to D2: 80%, HD: 16%, H2: 2%, I got the following.

T = 23.4 K
PD2 = 732.3 torr 
PHD = 1084.5 torr
PH2 = 1731.1 torr

The change in D2 pressure is 794 - 732 = 62 torr, corresponding to a change 
in the density of 0.0012 g/ml or 0.79%, with respect to that of 794 torr. 

This is a very small change in the density. 

This change in induced by the change/uncertain of the gas fraction. If you 
already taking into account the gas fraction is your calculation, you need to 
think about how to incorporate this small uncertainty.
