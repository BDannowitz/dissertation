\begin{abstract}
A measurement of the atomic mass ($A$) dependence of $p+A\rightarrow\mu^+\mu^- + X$ Drell-Yan dimuons produced by \unit[120]{GeV} protons is presented here. The data was taken by the SeaQuest experiment at Fermilab using a proton beam extracted from its Main Injector. Over 88,000 dimuon pairs were recorded with invariant mass $4.2 < M_{\gamma^*} < \unit[10] GeV$ and target parton momentum fraction $0.1\leq x_2 \leq 0.5$ for nuclear targets $^1H,\ ^2H,\ C,\ Fe,\ $and$\ W$. The ratio of dimuon yields per nucleon ($Y$) for heavy nuclei versus $^2H$, $R^{DY} = Y^{(A)} / Y^{(^2H)} \approx \bar{q}_u^{(A)}(x)/\bar{q}_u^{(^2H)}(x)$, is sensitive to modifications in the anti-quark sea distributions ($\bar{q}(x)$) in nuclei for the case of proton-induced Drell-Yan. The data analyzed here provides tighter constraints on various models that attempt to define the anomalous behavior of nuclear modification as seen in deep inelastic lepton scattering, a phenomenon better known as the EMC effect.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Preface}

Matters are rarely as simple as we hope them to be, and atomic nuclei are no exception. When physicists began to get a handle on proton structure, it was hoped that nuclei could be simply understood as a simple collection of the same, familiar protons and neutrons. Unfortunately, it turned out that \emph{more is different}, and higher order emergent behavior reared its head. It appeared that the distribution of partons within the proton became \emph{altered} when the proton was confined within a nucleus -- a phenomenon referred to as the EMC Effect. Since the discovery of this behavior, data and theories have proceeded to accumulate for over 30 years without a completely satisfying explanation, though recent breakthroughs give reason for optimism.

The SeaQuest experiment was commissioned and began taking data in 2012 with the expressed purpose to, among other physics goals, shed some additional light on this phenomon. I joined the collaboration in 2009 and have had the distinct pleasure of being a part of a large-scale, medium-energy experiment as it went from being an empty hall to a testing ground for nuclear physics. It has truly been a rewarding experience being able to contribute to a coordinated, monumental effort from the point of assembly all the way to its first publishable results (or at least very close).

In this thesis, I will describe in detail these contributions to the experiment. Chapter 1 will provide a broad outline regarding the background to the underlying physics and phenomenology. I attempt there to adequately describe the state of the field regarding the physics of unpolarized sea quark distributions along with what SeaQuest can contribute.
